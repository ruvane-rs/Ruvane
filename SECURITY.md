# Security

Ruvane is experimental and has not undergone an independent audit.

Version 0.1.0-alpha.1 provides HTML rendering only. Starting with
0.1.0-alpha.2, Ruvane also provides a loopback-only development server with
bounded socket I/O and an intentionally limited HTTP profile. It does not
provide TLS, sessions, authentication, server actions, or a production HTTP
implementation. See [the HTTP profile](docs/http-profile.md) and the README
for its exact syntax, defaults, and limitations.

The framework rejects ambiguous request framing before dispatch and uses
fixed response headers. HTML strings are escaped by the renderer. Handler
code remains trusted: response limits apply after construction, socket
deadlines do not interrupt application code, and shutdown waits for running
handlers to return. The normal panic hook still executes on a caught panic;
applications must keep sensitive data out of their own logs. Builds using
`panic = "abort"` cannot recover from handler panics.

Local binding and Host checks are not an authentication boundary against
other local programs. Read handlers must not perform state-changing actions.

For reporting options, consult the repository's Security tab. If private
vulnerability reporting is unavailable, contact a maintainer privately before
sharing sensitive details. Do not include credentials or personal data.

Security fixes may change the pre-release API. Users should follow the latest
pre-release and review its changelog.
