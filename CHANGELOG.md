# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

- Add a loopback-only HTTP development server using a bounded thread pool
  and connection queue, absolute I/O deadlines, and explicit shutdown.

  Host validation, and rejection of ambiguous framing before dispatch.
- Add exact-path GET routing, automatic HEAD responses, and typed response
  statuses with fixed headers and byte-correct content lengths.

  when application panics unwind.

  regression tests, and CI for stable Rust and the Rust 1.85 minimum version.
